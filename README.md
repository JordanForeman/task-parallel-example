task-parallel-example
=====================

*An example of a task-parallel program using OpenCL*

This program generates a random matrix (10x10, easily changed), and runs a simple function involving addition and multiplication in a data-parallel fashion on each item in the matrix.

There is also a time wrapped around the code to determine how long (in seconds) the entire operation takes.

This is part of a larger project for a [Parallel Programming] course to study the differences between task and data parallel applications in OpenCL.
